# Machine Learning App: CSV Upload & Random Forest Classifier  

This Streamlit app allows users to upload their CSV datasets, split the data into training and testing sets, and build a Random Forest Classifier model. The app provides insights into the model's performance and allows users to adjust hyperparameters for customization.  

## Features  
- **CSV File Upload**: Upload your dataset in CSV format for analysis.  
- **Data Splitting**: Set the train-test split ratio for your dataset.  
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Build and evaluate the performance of the Random Forest model.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust default hyperparameters like `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and more.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate the model with metrics such as accuracy_score, confusion_matrix and classification_report.

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.11 or above  
- Libraries: `streamlit`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`
